<p>From his earliest days <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has been an enthusiast for the Hunting
Field. But in this he has only been the faithful recorder of the manners
of his countrymen, as there is no sport more redolent of "Merrie
England" than that of the Horse and Hound. At no time in <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span>
history has he been without an artist who has specialised in the humours
of the hunt. First it was the inimitable Leech, some of whose drawings
find a place in the present collection, and then the mantle of the
sporting artist would seem to have descended to feminine shoulders, as
Miss Bowers (Mrs. Bowers-Edwards) wore it for some ten years after 1866.
That lady is also represented in the present work, at pages 49 and 111.
Later came Mr. G. H. Jalland, many of whose drawings we have chosen for
inclusion here. Perhaps the most popular of his hunting jokes was that
of the Frenchman exclaiming, "Stop ze chasse! I tomble, I faloff! <i>Stop
ze fox!!!</i>" (see page 141). To-day, of course, it is Mr. G. D. Armour
whose pencil is devoted chiefly to illustrating the humorous side of
hunting; but now, as formerly, most of the eminent artists whose work
lies usually in other fields, delight at times to find a subject
associated with the hunt. Thus we are able to present examples of Mr.
Cecil Aldin and Mr. Raven-Hill in sportive mood, while such celebrities
of the past as Randolph Caldecott and Phil May are here drawn upon for
the enriching of this, the first book of hunting humour compiled from
the abundant chronicles of <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>.</p>

<h3>THE HUNTING SEASON</h3>

<center>(<i>By Jorrocks Junior</i>)</center>

<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The season for hunting I see has begun,</p>
<p class="i0">So adieu for a time to my rod and my gun;</p>
<p class="i0">And ho! for the fox, be he wild or in bag,</p>
<p class="i0">As I follow the chase on my high-mettled nag.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I call him high-mettled, but still I must state,</p>
<p class="i0">He hasn't a habit I always did hate,</p>
<p class="i0">He doesn't walk sideways, like some "gees" you meet,</p>
<p class="i0">Who go slantindicularly down the street.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">He's steady and well broken in, for, of course,</p>
<p class="i0">I can't risk my life on an unbroken horse;</p>
<p class="i0">You might tie a torpedo or two on behind,</p>
<p class="i0">And though they exploded that horse wouldn't mind</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">My strong point is costume, and oft I confess</p>
<p class="i0">I've admired my get-up in a sportsmanlike dress;</p>
<p class="i0">Though, but for the finish their lustre confers,</p>
<p class="i0">I would much rather be, I declare, without spurs.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">They look very well as to cover you ride,</p>
<p class="i0">But I can't keep the things from the animal's side;</p>
<p class="i0">And the mildest of "gees," I am telling no fibs,</p>
<p class="i0">Will resent having liberties ta'en with his ribs.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then hie to the cover, the dogs are all there,</p>
<p class="i0">And the horn of the hunter is heard on the air;</p>
<p class="i0">I've a horn of my own, which in secret I stow,</p>
<p class="i0">For, oddly enough, they don't like me to blow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">We'll go round by that gate, my good sir, if you please,</p>
<p class="i0">I'm one of your sportsmen who rides at his ease;</p>
<p class="i0">And I don't care to trouble my courser to jump,</p>
<p class="i0">For whenever he does I fall off in a lump.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then haste to the meet! The Old Berkeley shall find,</p>
<p class="i0">If I don't go precisely as fast as the wind,</p>
<p class="i0">If they'll give my Bucephalus time to take breath,</p>
<p class="i0">We shall both of us, sometimes, be in at the death!</p>

<h2>DIARY OF THE MODERN HUNT SECRETARY</h2>

<blockquote><p>"Capping all non-subscribers is pretty generally resorted to, this
season, not only in the shires, but also with provincial
packs."&mdash;<i>Daily Press.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Splendid gallop after non-subscriber. Spotted the quarry on
good-looking chestnut, whilst we were drawing big covert. Edged my horse
over in his direction, but non-subscriber very wary&mdash;think he must have
known my face as "collector of tolls." Retired again to far side of
spinney and disguised myself in pair of false whiskers, which I always
keep for these occasions. Craftily sidled up, and finally got within
speaking distance, under cover of the whiskers, which effectually masked
my battery. "Beg pardon, sir," I began, lifting my hat, "but I don't
think I have the pleasure of knowing your name as a subscri&mdash;&mdash;" But he
was off like a shot. Went away over a nice line of country, all grass,
and a good sound take-off to most of the fences. Non-subscriber had got
away with about a three lengths lead of me, and that interval was fairly
maintained for the first mile and a half of the race. Then, felt most
annoyed to see that my quarry somewhat gained on me as we left the
pasture land and went across a holding piece of plough. Over a stiff
post and rails, and on again, across some light fallow, towards a big
dry ditch. The hunted one put his horse resolutely at it&mdash;must say he
rode very straight, but what <i>won't</i> men do to avoid "parting?"&mdash;horse
jumped short and disappeared from view together with his rider. Next
moment I had also come a cropper at ditch, and rolled down on top of my
prey. "Excuse me," I said, taking out my pocket-book and struggling to
my knees in six inches of mud, "but when you rather abruptly started
away from covertside, I was just about to remark that I did not think
you were a subscriber, and that I should have much pleasure in taking
the customary 'cap'&mdash;thank you." And he paid up quite meekly. We agreed,
as we rode back together, in the direction in which we imagined hounds
to be, that even if they had got away with a good fox, the field would
not be likely to have had so smart a gallop as he and I had already
enjoyed. Lost my day's hunting, of course.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Got away after another non-subscriber, led him over four
fields, after which he ran me out of sight. Lost my day's hunting again,
but was highly commended by M.F.H. for my zeal.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;M.F.H. pointed out five non-subscribers, and I at once
started off to "cap" them. Lost another day with hounds&mdash;shall send in

</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">But still she's a beauty, my little brown mare.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">She owns an aversion to windmills and ricks,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">When turned down to grass she oft strays out of bounds;</p>

<p class="i0">The too playful bite of my little brown mare.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">She prances like mad and she jumps like a flea,</p>
<p class="i0">And her waltz to a brass band is something to see:</p>
<p class="i0">No circus had ever a horse, I declare,</p>
<p class="i0">That could go through the hoops like my little brown mare.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I mount her but seldom&mdash;in fact, to be plain,</p>

<p class="i0">To risk it in riding my little brown mare!</p>

I'll get you to ride this young mare of mine. You see, I want to get her
qualified for our Hunt Cup, and she's not up to my weight, or I'd ride
her myself. Perhaps I'd better tell you she hasn't been ridden to hounds
before, so she's sure to be a bit nervous at first; and mind you steady
her at the jumps, as she's apt to rush them; and I wouldn't take her too
near other people, as she has a nasty temper, and knows how to use her
heels; and, whatever you do, don't let her get you down, or she'll tear
you to pieces. The last man that rode her is in hospital now. But keep
your eye on her, and remember what I've said, and you'll be all right!"</p>

<p class="i0">A waltz for me no more you'll keep, the girls appear to think</p>
<p class="i0">There's a law been made in favour of the wearing of the pink.</p>
<p class="i0">Sure I met you in the passage, and I took you by the hand,</p>
<p class="i0">And says I, "How many dances, Molly, darlint, will ye stand?"</p>
<p class="i0">But your card was full, you said it with a most owdacious wink,</p>
<p class="i0">And I'm "hanging" all your partners for the wearing of the pink!</p>
<p class="i0">You'd a waltz for Charlie Thruster, but you'd divil a one for me,</p>
<p class="i0">Though he dances like a steam-engine, as all the world may see;</p>
<p class="i0">'Tis an illigant divarsion to observe the crowd divide,</p>
<p class="i0">As he plunges down the ball-room, taking couples in his stride.</p>
<p class="i0">'Tis a cropper you'll be coming, but you know your business best,</p>
<p class="i0">Still, it's bad to see you romping round with Charlie and the rest;</p>
<p class="i0">Now you're dancing with Lord Arthur&mdash;sure, he's had enough to dhrink&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">And I'm "hanging" all your partners for the wearing of the pink!</p>
<p class="i0">Your cruelty ashamed you'll be someday to call to mind,</p>
<p class="i0">You'll be glad to ask my pardon, then, for being so unkind,</p>
<p class="i0">The hunting men are first, to-night&mdash;well, let them have their whack&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">You'll be glad to dance with me, someday&mdash;when all the coats are black!</p>
<p class="i0">But, since pink's the only colour now that fills your pretty head,</p>
<p class="i0">Bedad, I'll have some supper, and then vanish home to bed.</p>

<h2>HUNTING EXTRAORDINARY</h2>

<p>Jobson, who edits a cheerful little weekly, said to me the other day:</p>

<p>"You hunt, don't you?"</p>

<p>I looked at him knowingly. Jobson interpreted my smile according to his

<p>"Well, you might do me a bright little article&mdash;about half a column, you
know&mdash;on hunting, will you?"</p>

<p>Why should I hesitate? Jobson is safe for cash; and he had not asked me
to give my own experiences of the hunting field. I replied warily, "I
fancy I know the sort of thing you want."</p>

<p>"Good," he said, and before we could arrive at any detailed explanation
he had banged the door and dashed downstairs, jumped into his hansom and

<h3>THOUGHTS ON HUNTING.</h3>

<p>It is hardly possible to overrate the value of hunting as a National
sport. Steeplechasing is a Grand-National sport, but it is the sport of
the rich, whereas hunting is not. By judiciously dodging the Hunt
Secretary, you can, in fact, hunt for nothing. Of course, people will
come at me open-mouthed for this assertion, and say, "How about the keep
of your horses?" To which I reply, "If you keep a carriage, hunt the
carriage horse; if you don't, borrow a friend's horse for a long ride in
the country, and accidentally meet the hounds." To proceed. This has
been a season of poor scent. Of course, the horses of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> day
have deteriorated as line hunters: they possess not the keen sense of
smell which their grandsires had. But despite this the sport goes gaily
on. There are plenty of foxes&mdash;but we cannot agree with the popular idea
of feeding them on poultry. And yet, in every hunt, we see hunters
subscribing to poultry funds. This is not as it should be: Spott's meat
biscuit would be much better for foxes' food.</p>

<p>But these be details: let us hie forrard and listen to the cheery voice
of sly Reynard as he is winded from his earth. The huntsman blows his
horn, and soon the welkin rings with a chorus of brass instruments; the
tufters dash into covert, and anon the cheerful note of <i>Ponto</i> or
<i>Gripper</i> gives warning that a warrantable fox is on foot&mdash;well, of
course, he couldn't be on horseback, but this is merely a venatorial
<i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>. Away go the huntsmen, showing marvellous dexterity in
cracking their whips and blowing their horns at the same moment. Last of
all come the hounds, trailing after their masters&mdash;ah, good dogs, you
cannot hope to keep up very far with the swifter-footed horses!
Nevertheless, they strain at their leashes and struggle for a better
place at the horses' heels. "Hike forrard! tally ho! whoo-hoop!" They
swoop over the fields like a charge of cavalry. But after several hours'
hard running a check is at hand: the fox falters, then struggles on
again, its tail waving over its head. As its pursuers approach, it
rushes up a tree to sit on the topmost branch and crack nuts.</p>

<p>The panting horses arrive&mdash;some with their riders still in the saddle,
though many, alas! have fallen by the wayside. Next come the hounds, at
a long interval&mdash;poor <i>Fido</i>, poor <i>Vic</i>, poor <i>Snap</i>! you have done
your best to keep up, but the horses have out-distanced you! The
whipper-in immediately climbs the tree in which the little red-brown
animal still peacefully cracks its nuts, its pretty tail curled well
over its head. Its would-be captor carries a revolving wire cage, and,
by sleight-of-hand movement, manages to get the quarry securely into it.
Then he descends, places the cage in a cart and it is driven home.</p>

<p>The "mort" is sounded by four green velvet-coated huntsmen, with horns
wound round their bodies; a beautiful brush presented to the lady who
was first up at the "take"; and then the field slowly disperse. Tally
Ho-Yoicks! all is over for the day.</p>

<h2>OUR HUNT "POINT TO POINT"</h2>

<p>Last week our Point to Point steeplechase came off. So did several of
the riders: this merely <i>par parenth&egrave;se</i>. I offered to mark out the
course, and, as I intended to escape the dread ordeal of riding by
scratching my horse at the last moment, I thought it would be great fun
to choose a very stiff, not to say bloodthirsty, line. Awful grumbling
on the part of those unhappy ones who were to ride. Just as the bell
rang for saddling, Captain Sproozer, ready dressed for the fray, came up
to me with very long face, and said, "Beastly line this, you know,
Phunker. I call it much too stiff."</p>

<p>I smiled in pitying and superior manner. "Think so, my dear Sproozer? My
horse can't run, worse luck, but I only wish <i>I</i> were going to have the
gallop over it."</p>

<p>"So you shall, then!" cried a rasping voice, suddenly, from behind me.
Sir Hercules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> Blizzard was the speaker, an awful man with an awful
temper. "So you shall. My idiot of a jockey broke his collar-bone trying
to jump one of the fences on this confounded course of yours to-day, so,
as I am without a rider, you shall ride my mare Dinah."</p>

<p>Swallowed lump in my throat as I thanked him for his offer, but thought
I had better decline, as I didn't know the mare, and besides that, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! all right, I know what you are going to say: that you're not much
good on a horse"&mdash;(nothing of the sort! I was not going to say any such
thing, confound the man!) "Of course, I know all that, and that you're
not much of a rider; but I can't help myself now. It's too late to get a
decent horseman, so I shall have to make shift with you."</p>

<p>Deuced condescending of him. I made a feeble effort to escape, and would
cheerfully have paid a hundred pounds for the chance of doing so. Phil
Poundaway, great friend of mine, came up and said (sympathetically, as I
thought at first), "I should think you'd prefer to get off it, wouldn't
you, Phunker?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Thought he would volunteer in my place, so was perfectly frank with him.
"My dear Phil, I'd give a hundred to get off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you will, I expect, at the first fence, without paying the money!"
he grinned, as he turned away.</p>

<p>Murder was in my heart at that moment. I got on Dinah, and, feeling
like death, rode down to the starting-post. Thoughts of a misspent youth, of
home and friends and things, came o'er me. I seemed once more to see
the little rose-covered porch, the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What on earth are you mooning about?" thundered the Blizzardian voice
in my ear. "Take hold of her head tighter than that, or you'll be off!"</p>

<p>The next moment the starter yelled "Go!" and away, like a whirlwind, we
sped across the first field, towards a huge, thick blackthorn fence, the
one I had thought to see such fun with. Fun! I never felt less funny in
my life, as we approached it at the rate of two thousand miles an hour!
The mare jumped high, but I jumped much higher, and seemed for a brief
moment to be soaring through the blue empyrean. Somehow, the mare
managed to evade me on the return journey earthwards, and, instead of
alighting on the saddle, I found myself "sitting on the floor." A
howl&mdash;it might have been of sympathy, but it didn't sound quite like
that&mdash;arose from the crowd, and then I thought that I would go home on
foot, instead of returning to explain matters to Sir Hercules. As a
matter of fact, I don't much care for associating with old Blizzard, at
all events, not just now.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
